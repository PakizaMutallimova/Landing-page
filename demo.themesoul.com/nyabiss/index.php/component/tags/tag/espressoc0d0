			<description><![CDATA[<p>The first coffee shop that I visited during my stay and I kept going back. The staff was so welcoming and the prices for coffee are amazing. There is Wifi and lovely seating. It is a great coffee shops to meet new people in, as well it is very central in Ubud. The coolest thing was the Latte art that surprised me when I ordered. There was a Pirate in my Latte.Â </p>
